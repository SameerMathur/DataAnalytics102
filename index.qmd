Welcome to "Data Analytics 102 -- Applied Statistics and Regression Using R". This book is your guiding light in the complex world of data analysis and is designed for those who have already dipped their toes into the vast ocean of data analytics and wish to dive deeper. This book follows "Data Analytics 101" and expands on the fundamental statistical concepts, focusing on linear regression and its myriad applications.

The first section of the book navigates the diverse landscape of applied statistics. We cover a wide array of topics, including hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and various statistical models. Along with learning the theory, you'll also gain a firm understanding of how these methods can be applied in the real world to yield valuable insights.

In the second section, we will venture into the heart of linear regression, where we'll delve into the concepts, theory, and applicability of this powerful statistical technique. This includes a detailed examination of the principles of linear regression, the assumptions that underpin it, the concept of multicollinearity, outlier analysis, and much more. Each theoretical concept is accompanied by practical examples that illustrate its use, making the learning process engaging and exciting. 

One of the core components of this book is the R programming language, a powerful tool in the field of statistics and data analytics. Through our step-by-step tutorials, you will learn how to employ R for data exploration, visualization, and performing intricate statistical calculations. Whether you're a seasoned coder or new to programming, our clear and comprehensive instructions make the R language accessible and useful. 

Throughout the book, we have incorporated datasets to help illustrate our points and to provide you with practical, hands-on experience. By working on these datasets, you'll see the concepts come alive, while also learning how to address the unique challenges that come with different types of data.

"Data Analytics 102 -- Linear Regression and Applied Statistics Using R" aims to transform you from a beginner to a proficient data analyst who can navigate the world of data with confidence and expertise.
